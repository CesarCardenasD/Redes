        "### Required reading\n",
        "Sections: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technology perspective\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What are the different technologies used for connecting nodes in a computer network?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Computer networks use various technologies for connecting nodes, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and fiber optics. These technologies use different physical mediums and protocols for data transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is encoding in the context of computer networking?\n",
        "* Encoding is the process of converting data into a format suitable for transmission over a network. It ensures that data can be accurately transmitted and received.\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between analog and digital signals.\n",
        "* Analog signals are continuous and represent data as varying voltages or frequencies, while digital signals are discrete and represent data as binary values (0 - 1).\n",
        "3. Explain the different types of encoding used in computer networks\n",
        "* Different types of encoding in computer networks include Manchester encoding, Differential Manchester encoding, and Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) encoding.\n",

        "## Error Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is error detection and why is it important in computer networks?\n",
        "* Error detection is crucial in computer networks to identify and correct data transmission errors.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of parity checking for error detection.\n",
        "* Parity checking involves adding an extra bit, parity bit, to data to make the total number of 1s either even, even parity, or odd, odd parity.If a single bit error occurs, it can be detected.\n",
        "3. Discuss the advantages and limitations of parity checking.\n",
        "* Advantages include simplicity, but it can only detect single-bit errors. It cannot correct errors or detect certain types of multiple-bit errors.\n",
        "4. Describe the process of using checksums for error detection.\n",
        "* Checksums involve calculating a sum or checksum value for data, which is sent along with the data. The receiver recalculates the checksum and checks for discrepancies.\n",
        "5. Explain Cyclic Redundancy checks.\n",
        "* CRC is an error-detection algorithm that uses polynomial division to calculate a remainder. The remainder, known as the CRC value, is appended to the data and transmitted. The recipient performs the same calculation and checks for any discrepancies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reliable Transmission\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is reliable transmission and why is it important in computer networks?\n",
        "* Reliable transmission ensures that data sent from one node is successfully received by another. It's crucial to maintain data integrity and application performance.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of stop-and-wait protocol for reliable transmission.\n",
        "* In the stop-and-wait protocol, the sender sends one packet and waits for an acknowledgment from the receiver before sending the next packet.\n",
        "3. Discuss the advantages and limitations of stop-and-wait protocol.\n",
        "* Advantages include simplicity and reliability. Limitations include low efficiency due to frequent waiting for acknowledgments, which can lead to network congestion.\n",
        "4. Describe the process of using sliding window protocol for reliable transmission.\n",
        "* Sliding window protocols allow multiple packets to be in transit simultaneously, improving efficiency and throughput.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ethernet and Multiple Access Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Ethernet and how does it work?\n",
        "* Ethernet is a widely used LAN,Local Area Network, technology that uses a protocol to control access to the network medium.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of multiple access networks.\n",
        "* These are networks where multiple devices share a common communication medium.\n",
        "3. Discuss the advantages and limitations of Ethernet.\n",
        "* Ethernet is scalable and cost-effective but may experience collisions in shared media environments.\n",
        "4. Describe the process of collision detection in Ethernet.\n",
        "* In Ethernet, if two devices transmit at the same time and a collision occurs, they detect it and follow a collision resolution algorithm.\n",
        "5. Give examples of different multiple access techniques used in computer networks.\n",
        "* Examples of multiple access techniques include CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA.\n",

        "*  Wireless networks use radio waves to transmit data between devices.\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of wireless communication channels.\n",
        "* Wireless communication channels refer to the physical medium over which wireless signals propagate.\n",
        "3. Discuss the advantages and limitations of wireless networks.\n",
        "* Wireless networks offer mobility but can be susceptible to interference and have limited range.\n",
        "4. Describe the process of wireless signal propagation and interference.\n",
        "*  Wireless signals can be affected by obstacles, reflections, and interference from other devices.\n",
        "5. Give examples of different wireless networking technologies used in computer networks.\n",
        "* Examples of wireless networking technologies include Wi-Fi (802.11), Bluetooth, and cellular networks (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G).\n",
